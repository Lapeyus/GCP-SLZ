The code is creating a Terraform module named "tf_state" using the Google Cloud Storage simple bucket module,
with a specified name, project ID from the `org_seed_project` module, location set to 'us-east1',
enforced public access prevention, and an IAM policy granting 'storage.objectViewer' role to the group 'gcp-organization-admins@ownerpower.com'.

This Bucket holds the SLZ terraform state

```hcl
module "tf_state" {
  source                   = "terraform-google-modules/cloud-storage/google//modules/simple_bucket"
  version                  = "~> 4.0"

  project_id               = module.org_seed_project.project_id
  location                 = "us-east1"
  public_access_prevention = "enforced"
  iam_members = [
    {

This Bucket holds the CICD Project terraform state

```hcl

}
```

This code is creating local Terraform variables that filter out specific buckets from the `projecta_folders`,
`projectb_folders`, and `projectc_folders` modules based on their keys, excluding those with keys "${var.owner}-projecta",
"${var.owner}-projectb", and "${var.owner}-projectc" respectively.

```hcl
locals {
  filtered_projecta_buckets = { for k, v in module.projecta_folders.id : k => v if k != "${var.owner}-projecta" }
  filtered_projectb_buckets  = { for k, v in module.projectb_folders.id : k => v if k != "${var.owner}-projectb" }
  filtered_projectc_buckets    = { for k, v in module.projectc_folders.id : k => v if k != "${var.owner}-projectc" }
}
