# Altus Project Modules Documentation

This document explains the Terraform code responsible for managing Altus ingest, curated, and transformation projects within Google Cloud Platform.

## Overview

The code snippet consists of three distinct modules that handle the creation of projects under filtered folders for ingest, curated, and transformation. Each module uses the Google Project Factory module and filters out specific folders by name.

## Local Variables

The code starts by defining local variables that filter out folders based on their names.

```hcl
locals {
  filtered_ingest_folders  = { for k, v in module.ingest_folders.id : k => v if k != "Altus-Ingest" }
  filtered_curated_folders = { for k, v in module.curated_folders.id : k => v if k != "Altus-Cur" }
  filtered_trans_folders   = { for k, v in module.trans_folders.id : k => v if k != "Altus-Trans" }
}
```

## Altus Ingest Projects Module

This module handles the creation of ingest projects using the filtered ingest folders.

```hcl
module "altus_ingest_projects" {
  for_each                 = local.filtered_ingest_folders
  source                   = "terraform-google-modules/project-factory/google"
  version                  = "14.2.0"
  ...
  labels = {
    terraform_managed = true
  }
}
```

## Altus Curated Projects Module

Similar to the ingest module, this module creates curated projects based on the filtered curated folders.

```hcl
module "altus_curated_projects" {
  for_each                 = local.filtered_curated_folders
  ...
  labels = {
    terraform_managed = true
  }
}
```

## Altus Transformation Projects Module

This module is responsible for the transformation projects, created under the filtered transformation folders.

```hcl
module "altus_trans_projects" {
  for_each                 = local.filtered_trans_folders
  ...
  labels = {
    terraform_managed = true
  }
}
```

## Usage

Apply this code to manage Altus ingest, curated, and transformation projects within your Google Cloud Platform organization.
