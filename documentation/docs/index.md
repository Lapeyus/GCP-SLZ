# Google Cloud Landing Zone

## Introduction

A Google Cloud Landing Zone is the foundational framework of a Google Cloud environment. This configured environment aims to standardize the cloud infrastructure — providing a baseline for resource organization, policy management, identity and access control, and more.

Landing zones are a rather universal concept of multi-account architecture (used in Google Cloud, AWS, Azure, etc.) and serve as a blueprint for a cloud environment. They create an effective operational and governance model to drive a adoption strategy, determine how the team will collaborate, and ensure security and control as we grow.


## The Lasting Benefits of Google Cloud Landing Zone

Proper setup and implementation of Google Cloud best practices will provide a robust and long-lasting cloud infrastructure. It’ll be more secure, easier to manage, cost-efficient, and scalable.

- Centralized resource management provided as part of a Google Cloud Landing Zone setup will also enable more visibility and controlled access so that each infrastructure change can be properly tracked and authorized.
  
- Google Cloud Landing Zone mitigates risks by enacting security policies and controls based on several key benchmarks and compliance frameworks.
