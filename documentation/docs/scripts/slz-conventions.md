# Terraform Best Practices on Google Cloud Platform
this code adheres to best practices and conventions recommended by Google
[GCP's Best practices for using Terraform](https://cloud.google.com/docs/terraform/best-practices-for-terraform/)

keep them in mind when extending this code:

## Variables
- **Use Descriptive Names**: Always use descriptive names for variables, resources, and modules.
- **Provide Default Values**: Where applicable, provide default values for variables.
- **Use Variable Descriptions**: Always describe what each variable does and its impact.

## Modules
- **Module Reusability**: Create reusable modules for resources that are used frequently.
- **Version Pinning**: Always pin the version of your modules and providers.

## State Management
- **Remote Backend**: Use a remote backend like GCS for state files.
- **State Locking**: Enable state locking to prevent conflicts.
- **Sensitive Data**: Never store sensitive data in your state file.

## Resource Naming
- **Consistency**: Maintain a consistent naming convention for all resources.
- **Environment Specific**: Include the environment in the name (e.g., `prod_`, `dev_`).

## IAM Policies
- **Least Privilege**: Always follow the principle of least privilege.
- **IAM Roles over Users**: Prefer roles over individual user permissions.

## Networking
- **Subnet Planning**: Plan your subnets and CIDR blocks carefully to avoid overlap.
- **Firewall Rules**: Be explicit with your firewall rules; avoid using wildcards unless necessary.

## Logging and Monitoring
- **Enable Logging**: Always enable logging for critical resources.
- **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring and alerts for your infrastructure.

## Code Organization
- **Structure**: Organize your code into logical directories and files.
- **Readme**: Always include a README file for documentation.

## Testing
- **Plan**: Always run `terraform plan` before `terraform apply`.
- **Automated Testing**: Implement automated testing for your modules.

## Documentation
- **In-line Comments**: Use in-line comments to explain complex code blocks.
- **Output Values**: Document output values from modules and root modules.

## Version Control
- **Source Control**: Always use a source control system like Git.
- **Commit Messages**: Write meaningful commit messages.

## Continuous Integration
- **Pipeline**: Implement a CI/CD pipeline for your Terraform code.
- **Code Reviews**: Always perform code reviews before merging changes.
