# Secure Landing Zone Folder Structure

## Overview

This code snippet defines a hierarchical folder structure within Google Cloud Platform, designed to be a core component of a secure landing zone strategy. The folder structure promotes segregation of responsibilities and isolation of different environment aspects, such as billing, logging, security, networking, and shared resources.


### Secure Landing Zone Context

The design emphasizes security by:

- **Isolating Responsibilities**: By segregating resources into dedicated folders, you minimize the risk of unintended access or modifications.
- **Scalable Organization**: This structure allows for expandable management and the easy addition of more departments, projects, or environmental divisions.
- **Hierarchical Access Control**: Implementing IAM policies at different folder levels provides fine-grained control, supporting the principle of least privilege. Also, when the permissions are attached to the folder and not the projects them selves the unerlying projects can be created, recreated destroyed, and the owners of the folder will still maintain the same privileges through inheritance.
- **Auditability**: Audit logs are enabled, improving visibility and compliance.
