# Secure Landing Zone Folder Structure

## Overview

This code snippet defines a hierarchical folder structure within Google Cloud Platform, designed to be a core component of a secure landing zone strategy. The folder structure promotes segregation of responsibilities and isolation of different environment aspects, such as billing, logging, security, networking, and shared resources.


### Secure Landing Zone Context

The design emphasizes security by:

- **Isolating Responsibilities**: By segregating resources into dedicated folders, you minimize the risk of unintended access or modifications.
- **Scalable Organization**: This structure allows for expandable management and the easy addition of more departments, projects, or environmental divisions.
- **Hierarchical Access Control**: Implementing IAM policies at different folder levels provides fine-grained control, supporting the principle of least privilege.
- **Auditability**: The Logging and Monitoring folder can be configured to centralize logs, improving visibility and compliance.
