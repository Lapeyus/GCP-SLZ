## Role Assignments for Administrative Groups in Secure Landing Zone üõ°Ô∏è

!!! danger
In order to mantain this implementation as an effective and secure landing zone on GCP, you should consider the principle of least privilege,
where you should grant only the necessary access to users, groups and services to perform their tasks.

In a GCP organization, the secure management of resources requires a clear delineation of responsibilities among different administrative roles. This code snippet defines the IAM role bindings for various administrative groups within the organization, ensuring alignment with the SLZ's security principles.

By carefully attaching the appropriate roles to administrative groups, this code maintains a secure and effective governance structure. The implementation follows the SLZ principles, ensuring that access controls are applied precisely where needed and aligning with the organization's broader security strategy.
